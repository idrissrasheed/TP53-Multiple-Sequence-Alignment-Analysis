# TP53-Multiple-Sequence-Alignment-Analysis

Manually obtaining data from the GenBank database is a time-consuming process, so I created a program with Biopython to access GenBank from your Python console. To exhibit this process, I used the TP53 gene in humans as an example. With the TP53-Gene-Multiple-Alignment program, I extracted sequences from GenBank, output the sequence data into a GBK file, and created a FASTA file from the GBK file. Then used SeqIO, Seq, and AlignIO to read and access the FASTA file after padding with the Read-Alignment program.
